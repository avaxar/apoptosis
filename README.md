## Description

A top-scroller physics-based game where one has to avoid obstacles and bubble-shooting enemies and use Newton's third law to propel yourself as you shoot bubbles back.

## Controls

The primary control that you will use is the mouse. Hold the **Left Mouse Button** to charge your bubblegun using the air inside your bubble; the **longer** the click, the **bigger** and **faster** the bubble pellet. Pay attention to the barometer on the bottom left as to not drain your bubble's air supply!

These are controls to move the character within the bubble for increased precision:

- **A** or **←** to move leftwards in the bubble.
- **D** or **→** to move rightwards in the bubble.
- **Space** or **W** or **↑** to jump in the bubble.

## Objectives

- Avoid the enemies' bubble pellets.
- Avoid clashing into enemy bubbles.
- Shoot enemies if needed.
- Strategize the recoil mechanism of your bubblegun to move around the map.
- Avoid the obstacles and circumnavigate around them.
- Reach the end and save your feline buddy!
